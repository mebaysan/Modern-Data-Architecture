# Introduction

I created this repo to simulate modern data architecture by using the tools below.

- [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/)
- [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com/)
  - [Source](./Source/) folder is created to provide data for dbt.
  - [modern_data_architecture](./modern_data_architecture/) folder is the dbt project for the data provided in [Source](./Source/) folder. The data is from Kaggle by [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).
- [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/)
